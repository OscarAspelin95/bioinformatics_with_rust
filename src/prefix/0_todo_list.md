# TODO list
Here are some things I'd want to add to this book, in no particular order:
- Misc:
    - Width of book, the end of some lines disappear to the right.
    - GC content for a sliding window of a long nucleotide string (with plot).
    - ~Break kmer bit shift into separate sections?~
    - ~Counting/finding homopolymers.~

- Rust Tips and Tricks:
    - Error Handling
    - More topics.

- Kmers:
    - ~Add minimizers~
    - Add syncmers

- Alignment:
    - ~Implement a local aligner (Smith-Waterman, with traceback).~
    - Add support for finding all alignments from a local aligner?
    - Create a simple multiple sequence alignment?


- Visualization
    - ~Alignment visualization desktop app.~
    - How to generate nice plots in Rust.

- Assembly:
    - The basics of assembly.
    - Build a De-Bruijn graph.
    - Build an overlap graph.
    - Eularian walk?
    - Section about the difficulties and challenges with assembly.

- Pipelines (how do we solve dependencies in mdbook? Otherwise just write text and link to GitHub):
    - Basic BLAST pipeline.
    - Basic read alignment pipeline.
    - Basic assembly pipeline.
    - Metagenomic classification with sylph.
    - SINTAX classifier in Rust.

    Can implement in repo, write text in mdbook and link to repo.
