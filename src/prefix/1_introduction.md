# Introduction
Welcome to Bioinformatics with Rust! An unofficial book aimed at introducing the Rust programming language for bioinformatic applications. Before we start:

* This book is **not** in any way, shape or form, an official introduction to neither the Rust programming language, nor bioinformatics.

* The **purpose** of this book is to simply give some inspiration on how the Rust programming language
can be used to create fast and memory safe bioinformatics pipelines.

* For any issues related to this book, please file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/OscarAspelin95/bioinformatics_with_rust/issues).

* Contributions are very welcome!
