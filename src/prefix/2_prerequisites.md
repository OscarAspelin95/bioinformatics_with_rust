# Prerequisites
If you have never heard of the Rust programming language or bioinformatics, this book is probably not for you.

If you have a lot of experience with both Rust and bioinformatics, this book is probably not for you.

However, if you know a bit about bioinformatics and have worked with programming languages such as Python or C++ then this book will give you an introduction to the Rust ecosystem for building bioinformatic pipelines!
