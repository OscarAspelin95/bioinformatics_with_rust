# About AI
I want to start this section by stating that I strongly opted out of vibe-coding this project. If I did, I'd probably been done in a day or two. Instead, I chose the proper (and difficult) path of trying things out, failing, swearing, reading documentation and finally (somewhat) understanding. This probably means there are some text and code-snippets in this book that are not 100% correct. I'm okay with that, because it means there is room for improvement.

With that said, I <em>have</em> used AI as a tool for the following:
- Asking questions about my code to find potential bugs, weaknesses and edge cases.
- Explain Rust concepts that I did not fully understand (such as declarative macros).
- Asking for suggestions on performance improvements and implemented them only if I can understand why it makes the code more performant.

## The Future of AI
This might be a hot-take, but I think that we are in an AI bubble at the moment, where the hype does not seem to live up to the expectations. In recent time, we have seem multiple disappointing releases of models and agents from companies that drive the AI train.

Ultimately, I don't think AI is bad. It can be incredibly useful. What I do think is that people are using it incorrectly. Multiple news channels have reported a MIT report, showing that 95% of organizations gain zero return using tools such as ChatGTP and Copilot. The report also shows that the primary productivity gain is on the individual level and not necessarily on large scale.

This tells me something, namely that software developers are not going to be replaced anytime soon. At least not completely.
