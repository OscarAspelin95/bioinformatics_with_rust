# About AI
I want to start this section by stating that I strongly opted out of vibe-coding this project. If I did, I'd probably been done in a day or two. Instead, I chose the proper (and difficult) path of trying things out, failing, swearing, reading documentation and finally (somewhat) understanding. This probably means there are some text and code-snippets in this book that are not 100% correct. I'm okay with that, because it means there is room for improvement.

With that said, I <em>have</em> used AI as a tool for the following:
- Asking questions about my code to find potential bugs, weaknesses and edge cases.
- Explain Rust concepts that I did not fully understand (such as declarative macros).
- Asking for suggestions on performance improvements and implemented them only if I can understand why it makes the code more performant.
