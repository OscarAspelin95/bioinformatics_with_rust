# About AI
I want to start this section by stating that I strongly opted out of vibe-coding this project. If I did, I'd probably been done in a day or two. Instead, I chose the proper (and difficult) path of trying things out, failing, swearing, reading documentation and finally (somewhat) understanding. This probably means there are some text and code-snippets in this book that are not 100% correct. I'm okay with that, because it means there is room for improvement.

With that said, I <em>have</em> used AI as a tool for the following:
- Asking questions about my code to find potential bugs, weaknesses and edge cases.
- Explain Rust concepts that I did not fully understand (such as declarative macros).
- Asking for suggestions on performance improvements and implemented them only if I can understand why it makes the code more performant.
- Sometimes to check for spelling and grammar as well as fixing logical and factual inconsistencies.

## The Future of AI
My take on AI is that we are in a hype at the moment. I think that the hype might not live up to the expectations. In recent time, we have seem multiple disappointing releases of models and agents from companies that drive the AI train.

Ultimately, I don't think AI is bad. It can be incredibly useful. What I do think is that people are using it incorrectly. Multiple news channels have reported a MIT report, showing that 95% of organizations gain zero return using tools such as ChatGTP and Copilot. The report also shows that the primary productivity gain is on the individual level and not necessarily on large scale.

With that said, Claude is very, very good at writing lots of code.
