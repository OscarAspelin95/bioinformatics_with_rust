Here are some things I'd want to add to this book, in no particular order:
- [x] Chapters:
    - [ ] Rust Basics.
    - [ ] in silico PCR.
    - [ ] Clustering
    - [ ] Aminoacids - the basics around translation, codons, etc.

- [ ] Misc smaller things:
    - [ ] Width of book, the end of some lines disappear to the right.
    - [ ] GC content for a sliding window of a long nucleotide string (with plot).

- [ ] Rust Tips and Tricks:
    - [ ] More topics than what is currently covered.

- [ ] Kmers:
    - [ ] Add syncmers
