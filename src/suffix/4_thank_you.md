# Thank You
This was it. If you have made it to this point, I sincerely want to thank you for spending your time reading through this book.

Initially, this started off as a private project with the goal of learning more about the Rust programming language. Since my background is in biotech/bioinformatics, the combination Rust + bioinformatics felt very natural to me. Along the way, I realized that even though there are some bioinformatic tools written in Rust, there was no real good tutorial on how well Rust integrates with the bioinformatic landscape.

Whilst working on this project, I realized that this might as well be a public project.
