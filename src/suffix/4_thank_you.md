# Thank You
This was it. If you have made it to this point, I sincerely want to thank you for spending your time reading through this book.

Initially, this started off as a private project with the goal of learning more about the Rust programming language. Since my background is in biotech/bioinformatics, the combination Rust + bioinformatics felt very natural to me. Along the way, I realized that even though there are some bioinformatic tools written in Rust, there was no real good tutorial on just how well Rust integrates with the bioinformatic landscape.

I strongly opted out of vibe-coding this entire book. If I'd used ChatGPT and something like Claude, this project would probably have been done in a few days. Instead, I chose the difficult but proper way of reading a lot of resources and documentation. I did a lot of testing and failing until I reached something I thought was good enough. It is not perfect, nowhere close actually.

## Contributions
This project is far from done. It probably never will be. However, I stand by the concept of open-source and people working together to create software that is available for everyone. If you feel like you could contribute in any shape, way or form, then I'd be more than open to this.
