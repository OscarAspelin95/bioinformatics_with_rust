# Advanced Topics
In this section, we explore more advanced techniques that build on the foundations covered earlier in the book. These topics focus on pushing performance further and solving problems that arise when working with large-scale genomic data. We cover SIMD vectorization for parallel kmer processing and reverse indices for efficient sequence search.
