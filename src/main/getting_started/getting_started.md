# Getting Started
First and foremost, we need to install Rust and its package manager Cargo. The easiest way to do this is to use [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) and follow the installation instructions.

Second, we need a code editor. If you want to make your life a living hell, you can use notepad. However, then we are missing some important stuff, like syntax highlighting, code formatting and much more. Here are some examples of code editors that can get the job done:
- [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Easy to use with lots of plugins to make your life easier.
- [Zed](https://zed.dev/) - A text editor written in Rust!
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) - For hardcore programmers.
- [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) - For modern, hardcore programmers.

Personally, I prefer Zed. It is fast and has first-class support for Rust.
