# Practicals
So far, we have not seen any code examples of using external crates. In this chapter, the reader is encouraged to implement their own solutions to the suggested problems, using their own code in combination with suitable Rust crates.

For each problem, there is a description of what should be implemented, what Rust crates would be suitable and also links to examples to take inspiration from.
